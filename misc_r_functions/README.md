misc_R_functions
================

This repo contains a set of *.R files that I have found very useful for general data analysis tasks.

To use the R functions, just include `source("./PATH/TO/FILE/FILE.R")` in your R code.
For instance: `source("/ebio/abt3_projects/Georg_animal_feces/code/init.R")`.
